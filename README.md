This is the plugin that I ran on and old Minecraft server. It was used for essential commands and gags.

Writing this plugin is what got me interested in programming and want to study Computer Science in college.

TO USE:
You will need to compile the java files into a .jar file and drag it in the plugins folder of a bukkit or spigot server using an IDE such as Eclipse.
